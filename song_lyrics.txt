My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

"We were born sick," you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

There's an art to life's distractions
To somehow escape the burning weight, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha, that you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day

Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better

I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around, when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud creatures baying
All I've ever done is hide
From our times when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights, and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life

But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you

There are questions I can't ask
Now at last the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against your body's borders
I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh someday
Our baby and her momma
And the damaged love she made

But I don't know what else that I would do
Than try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Than feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you
Babe, there's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?

Babe, there's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

No tired sighs, no rolling eyes, no irony
No 'who cares', no vacant stares, no time for me

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Babe, there's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin

Babe, there's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this.
Oh, what a sin

To the strand a picnic plan for you and me
A rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door
Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat
There's nothing sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she put her love down soft and sweet
In the low lamp light I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
I had a thought, dear
However scary
About that night
The bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging?
What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me
From the earth?

I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I knew that look dear
Eyes always seeking
Was there in someone
That dug long ago
So I will not ask you
Why you were creeping
In some sad way I already know

So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do
Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh but she burns
Like rum on a fire
Hot and fast and angry
As she can be
I walk my days on a wire

It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mamma, don't fuss over me

The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Calls of guilty thrown at me
All while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully
Just like she throws with the arm of her brother

But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

Way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful
I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

Way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
When I was a child, I heard voices...
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices...
I learned the voices died with me

When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame
Something in it had a power,
Could barely tear my eyes away

All you have is your fire...
And the place you need to reach -
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash



When I was 16, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me...
I knew the scent was mine alone

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash

When I was a man I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

All you have is your fire,
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons,
But always keep 'em on a leash...
I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now

The words hung above
But never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

I had no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now

Dragging along
Follow in your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

I was housed by your warmth
Thus transformed
By your grounded and giving
And darkening scorn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising


And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power


It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising


And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
B.B. cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power


And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free


But I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power
James cried power
Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie, power
Dylan, power
Woody, power
Nina cried power
I came in from the outside, burnt out from a joyride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is Stella by Starlight
That was my heart, the drums that start off night and day

The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

Tell me who and I'll be thanking 'em
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing?
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing

I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

The very thought of you and am I blue
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh the radio newsreader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me, awake, and ask, 'Is everything alright?'

And, Lord, I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the Gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singing
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicing shame
When the earth is trembling on some new beginning
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)

Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered sin (lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Be the hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (lover, be good to me)
That's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost
Oh lover, be good to me

When the man who gives the order
Is born next time around on the boat sent back
When the bodies starving at the border
Are on TV giving people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh when there's nothing left for you and I to do
Oh when there's nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love for you now

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)

Be love in its disrepute (lover, be good to me)
That scorches the hillside and salts every root (lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowing and starving of troops
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Be there and just as you stand (lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand (lover, be good to me)
That will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)

Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?

(Lover, be good to me)
I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found
Hey yeah
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground
Hey yeah
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around
Hey yeah
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love
Hey yeah
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of
Hey yeah
That's found in the last witness before the wave hits
Marvelling at God
Hey yeah
Before he feels alone one final time
And marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you
True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
Willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicos
Over canopy dapple long ago
True that love in withdrawal was the weeping of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
I fretted fire but that was long ago

And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Your blinding light (Oooh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (Oooh)

Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

With the roar of the fire my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I cut loose I was never the same
Watching still living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Laying waste to my loving long ago

But that's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Of your blinding light (Oooh)
And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright, honey (Oooh)

Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

So in awe there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the "would that I loved" is long ago

And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Of your blinding light (Oooh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (Oooh)

Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to
Oh, you're good to me
You're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby
I would shun the light
Share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Whose heart would not take flight?
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight
Oh sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight

Oh, the tale is the same
Told before and told again
A soul that's born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
At last can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was something foreknown to me, sunlight
Oh sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Sunlight

All these colours fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight
All these colours fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight

Each day you rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad, happily
With wax melted I'd meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight

Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Remember once I told you about
How before I heard it from your mouth
My name would always hit my ears as such an awful sound
And the soul, if that's what you'd call it
Uneasy ally of the body, it felt nameless as a river
Undiscovered underground

And the first time that you kissed me
I drank dry the River Lethe
The Liffey would have been softer on my stomach all the same
But you spoke some quick new music
That went so far to soothe this soul
As it was and ever shall be, unearth without a name

Some part of me must have died
The first time that you called me, "Baby"
And some part of me came alive
The first time that you called me, "Baby"

These days I think I owe my life
To flowers that were left here by my mother
Ain't that like them, giftin' life to you again
This life lived mostly underground
Unknowin' either sight nor sound
'Til reachin' up for sunlight just to be ripped out by the stem

Sensing only now it's dyin'
Drying out, then drowning blindly
Bloomin' forth its every colour
In the moments it has left
To share the space with simple living things
Infinitely suffering, but fighting off like all creation
The absence of itself, anyway

Some part of me must have died
Each time that you called me, "Baby"
But some part of me stayed alive
Each time that you called, each time that you called

Come here
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around
Ooh-la-la, come here, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around

The last time it was heard out loud
The perfect genius of our hands and mouths were shocked
To resignation as the arguing declined
When I was young I used to guess
Are there limits to any emptiness?
When was the last time?
Come here to me, when was the last time?

Some part of me must have died
The final time that you called me, "Baby"
But some part of me came alive
The final time you called me, "Baby"
Do you think I'd give up
That this might've shook the love from me
Or that I was on the brink
How could you think darling I'd scare so easily?
Now that it's done
There's not one thing that I would change
My life was a storm
Since I was born
How could I fear any hurricane?

If someone asked me at the end

I'll tell them put me back in it
Darling, I would do it again
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I'd go through it again
I would still be surprised I could find you, darling
In any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I would do it again

For all that was said
Of where we'd end up at the end of it
When the heart would cease
Ours never knew peace
What good would it be on the far side of things?
But it was too soon
When that part of you was ripped away
A grip taking hold
Like a cancer that grows
Each piece of your body that it takes

Though I know my heart would break

I'll tell them put me back in it
Darling, I would do it again
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I'd go through it again
I would still be surprised I could find you, darling
In any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I would do it again

I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me

I feel lighter than I have in so much time
I've crossed the borderline of weightless
One deep breath out from the sky
I've reached a rarer height now
That I can confirm
All our weight is just a burden
Offered to us by the world
And though I burn
How could I fall?
When I am lifted by every word you say to me

If anything could fall at all
It's the world that falls away from me

You have me floating like a feather on the sea
While you're as heavy as the world
That you hold your hands beneath
Once I had wondered
What was holding up the ground
I can see that all along, love
It was you all the way down
Leave it now
I am sky-bound
If you need to, darling
Lean your weight to me

We'll float away
But if we fall, I only pray
Don't fall away from me

I do not have wings, love
I never will
Soaring over a world you are carrying
If these heights should bring my fall
Let me be your own
Icarian carrion

If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
If I should fall on that day
I only pray
Don't fall away from me
I'm starving, darling
Let me put my lips to something
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carving, darling
I wanna smell the dinner cooking
I wanna feel the edges start to burn

Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the getting is gone
I won't lie, if there's something to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young

You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to it
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, Highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal

Honey, I'm making sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie, if there's something still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young
Without shame
Two outfits then to my name
You'd end up in one when you'd stay
We had nowhere to go
And every desire for going there

I heard once
It's the comforts that make us feel numb
We'd go out with no way to get home
And we'd sleep on somebody's floor
And wake up feeling like a millionaire

Wish I'd known it was just our turn (We just got by)
Being blamed for a world we had no power in (But we tried)
You and I had nothing to show (We didn't know)
But the best of the world in the palm of our hands (Anything, darling)

And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done

One time we would want for nothing (One time we had it all, love)
We knew what our love was worth (When we had nothing)
Now we're always missing something (I miss when)
I miss when we did not need much

Oh, if the car ran, the car was enough
If the sun shone on us, it's a plus
And the tank was always filled up
Only enough for our getting there

(And you flew away) That first car was like wings on an angel
Before the whole wide world got too thin
(From me then) I swear goodwill kept up the engine
You were steering my heart like a wheel in your hands (Turn back, darling)

And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done

All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young
You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has a cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers love
Falling from you drop by drop

What I had left here
I just held it tight
So someone with your eyes
Might come in time
To hold me like water
Or Christ
Hold me like a knife

We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are

You and I burned out our steam
Chasing someone else's dream
How can something be so much heavier
But so much less than what it seems
Darling we sacrificed
We gave our time to something undefined
This phantom life
It sharpens like an image
But it sharpens like a knife

We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are

You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has its cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers love
Falling from you drop by drop
A two-tonne weight around my chest feels like
It just dropped a twenty-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
With their heart still intact, they didn't do it right

The last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said
"We didn't get it right, but, love, we did our best"
And we will again
Moving on in time and taking more from everything that ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again
We begin again

I have never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watched my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by being somebody's fault
But we've gone long enough to know this isn't what we want
And that isn't always bad
When people say that something is forever
Either way, it ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again
We begin again
We begin again, darling

And all things end
All that we intend is built of sand
Slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Won't change our plans
When we begin again

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again
You know the distance never made a difference to me
I swam a lake of fire, I'd have walked across the floor of any sea
Ignored the vastness between all that can be seen
And all that we believe
So I thought you were like an angel to me

Funny how true colours shine in darkness and in secrecy
If there were scarlet flags
They washed out in the mind of me
Where a blinding light shone on you every night
And either side of my sleep
Where you were held frozen like an angel to me

It ain't the being alone
Sha-la-la
It ain't the empty home, baby
Sha-la-la
You know I'm good on my own
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la, baby, you know it's more the being unknown
So much of the living, love, is the being unknown

You called me angel for the first time, my heart leapt from me
You smile now, I can see its pieces still stuck in your teeth
And what's left of it, I listen to it tick
Every tedious beat going unknown as any angel to me

Do you know, I could break beneath the weight
Of the goodness, love, I still carry for you?
That I'd walk so far just to take
The injury of finally knowing you

It ain't the being alone
Sha-la-la
It ain't the empty home, baby
Sha-la-la
You know I'm good on my own
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la, baby
You know it's more the being unknown
And there are some people, love, who are better unknown
One bright morning changes all things
Soft and easy as your breathing
You wake
Your eyes open at first a thousand miles away
But turning shoot a silver bullet point-blank range
And I can scarce believe what I'm believing in
Could this be how every day begins?

The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light

One bright morning goes so easy
Darkness always
Finds you either way
It creeps into the corners as the moment fades
A voice your body jumps to calling out your name
But after this I'm never gonna be the same
And I am never going back again

The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Sometimes it returns
Like rain that you slept through
That washed off the world
The streets looking brand new
I will not be great
But I'm grateful to get through
The feeling came late
I'm still glad I met you

The memory hurts
But does me no harm
Your hand in my pocket
To keep us both warm
The poor thing in the road
Its eye still glistening
The cold wet of your nose
The Earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Sometimes there's a thought
Like you choose what you're doing
But it comes to nought
When I look back through it
I remember the view
Street lights in the dark blue
The moment I knew
I'd no choice but to love you

The speed that you moved
The screech of the cars
The creature still moving
That slowed in your arms
The fear in its eyes
Gone out in an instant
Your tear caught the light
The Earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Darling, there's a part of me
I'm afraid will always be
Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life
The weeds up through the concrete
The traffic picking up speed
All my love and terror
Balanced there between those eyes

See how it shines
See how it shines
