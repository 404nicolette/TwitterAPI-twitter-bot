My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen

Babe, there's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?

Babe, there's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

No tired sighs, no rolling eyes, no irony
No 'who cares', no vacant stares, no time for me

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Babe, there's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin

Babe, there's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this.
Oh, what a sin

To the strand a picnic plan for you and me
A rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

I had a thought, dear
However scary
About that night
The bugs and the dirt

Why were you digging?
What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me
From the earth?

I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you

I knew that look dear
Eyes always seeking
Was there in someone
That dug long ago
So I will not ask you
Why you were creeping
In some sad way I already know

So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do

If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me

I feel lighter than I have in so much time
I've crossed the borderline of weightless

One deep breath out from the sky
I've reached a rarer height now
That I can confirm
All our weight is just a burden
Offered to us by the world

And though I burn
How could I fall?
When I am lifted by every word you say to me

If anything could fall at all
It's the world that falls away from me

You have me floating like a feather on the sea
While you're as heavy as the world

you hold your hands beneath
Once I had wondered
What was holding up the ground
I can see that all along, love
It was you all the way down
Leave it now

I am sky-bound
If you need to, darling
Lean your weight to me

We'll float away
But if we fall, I only pray
Don't fall away from me

I do not have wings, love
I never will

Soaring over a world you are carrying
If these heights should bring my fall
Let me be your own
Icarian carrion

If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me

If I should fall on that day
I only pray
Don't fall away from me

Do you think I'd give up
That this might've shook the love from me
Or that I was on the brink

How could you think darling I'd scare so easily?

Now that it's done
There's not one thing that I would change
My life was a storm
Since I was born
How could I fear any hurricane?

If someone asked me at the end

I'll tell them put me back in it
Darling, I would do it again
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I'd go through it again

I would still be surprised I could find you, darling
In any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I would do it again

For all that was said
Of where we'd end up at the end of it
When the heart would cease
Ours never knew peace

What good would it be on the far side of things?

But it was too soon
When that part of you was ripped away
A grip taking hold
Like a cancer that grows
Each piece of your body that it takes

Though I know my heart would break

I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
